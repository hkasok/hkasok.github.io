I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Tripura Institute of Technology.  I work in the interdisciplinary field of computational mechanics, which is a combination of engineering, computer science, and applied mathematics.  In particular, I develop numerical methods for fluid structure interaction problems using finite element method in a monolithic fully Eulerian framework.
