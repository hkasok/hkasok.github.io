I am a PhD student at Flroida International University.
My native place is Kozhikode in Kerala (a southern state of India). 
I can speak Malayalam and English. After my bachelor’s and master’s degree 
in engineering I worked in teaching and research positions for a few years 
in India. I enjoy being a researcher and I would like to be a researcher/professor 
in a good university with diverse international community. 
Therefore, it was natural for me to go for a PhD in this stage of career

Research interests
I work in the interdisciplinary field of computational mechanics, which is a combination of engineering mechanics, computer science, 
and applied mathematics. In some of the major projects I worked in the past, I developed numerical methods for fluid structure 
interaction problems using finite element method in a monolithic fully Eulerian framework, used computational software 
for heat exchanger designs and studied particle flow in polymer extrusion.
