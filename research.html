    <h1>Research Overview</h1>
    <p>
        My research integrates <strong>computational fluid dynamics (CFD)</strong>, 
        <strong>urban energy balance modeling</strong>, and 
        <strong>data-driven methods</strong> to understand and mitigate the 
        <em>Urban Heat Island (UHI)</em> effect in tropical cities. 
        The goal is to develop efficient numerical frameworks that can predict 
        microclimatic conditions and evaluate nature-based cooling strategies such as 
        tree canopies, green roofs, and reflective materials.
    </p>

    <h2>Urban Heat Island Mitigation</h2>
    <p>
        Urban Heat Island (UHI) effects occur when cities trap and store heat 
        due to dense infrastructure and limited vegetation. 
        My research investigates how surface materials, urban geometry, and vegetation 
        alter energy exchange between air, buildings, and the ground. 
        I model mitigation strategies such as tree canopy shading, evapotranspiration, 
        and cool pavements to improve outdoor thermal comfort and urban sustainability.
    </p>

    <h2>CFD Simulation of Tree Canopies and Microclimate</h2>
    <p>
        Using <strong>OpenFOAM</strong>, I develop and apply CFD models that capture 
        the detailed interactions between air flow, vegetation, and solar radiation. 
        This includes modeling aerodynamic drag, leaf area density, and radiation exchange 
        through the canopy using the <em>Finite Volume Discrete Ordinates Method (fvDOM)</em>. 
        The simulations are calibrated and validated with on-site field data collected 
        under tree canopies in Miami.
    </p>

    <h2>Solar Radiation and Energy Balance Modeling</h2>
    <p>
        A major component of my research focuses on coupling radiative and conductive 
        heat transfer processes using custom OpenFOAM solvers. 
        I implement the <strong>Sky View Factor (SVF)</strong> and 
        <strong>solar load models</strong> to represent the complex interaction of 
        buildings and vegetation with sunlight and longwave radiation. 
        This allows accurate prediction of surface and air temperature dynamics 
        in heterogeneous urban environments.
    </p>

    <h2>Machine Learning for Urban Microclimate Prediction</h2>
    <p>
        I apply <strong>machine learning and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)</strong> 
        to predict urban temperature, humidity, and heat flux patterns using large-scale 
        environmental and CFD-generated datasets. 
        These models integrate physical constraints and data-driven learning to enable 
        efficient prediction of microclimatic variables across space and time, 
        providing a fast alternative to high-resolution CFD simulations.
    </p>
